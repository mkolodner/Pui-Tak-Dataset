# Pui-Tak-Dataset

Repository holds a mapping and dataset for inserting data into sandboxes of Pui Tak Center using CumulusCI (CCI). See the flows in cumulusci.yml to clear and replace data.

In Visual Studio Code run: cci flow run ptc_cleandataset â€”org {orgalias}

Scratch org creation is not supported with this repo, so using the cci commands like dev_org will not likely be successful. This repo is only intended for dataset use.
